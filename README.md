## 📚 About

It is a project developed on the .NET platform (C#), which can simulate a system from an educational institution,
where it adds and stores data from the institution's teachers, students and suppliers through txt files
(where these files can have their extensions changed, manually, for csv and working with data in more depth),
read these files through the software, in addition to sending emails directly from the application.

Here I used Windows 10, .NET (C#) and Visual Studio Comunity to practiced Object Orientation,
flux control, keyboard reading, logic work with text files, directory and send e-mails.
